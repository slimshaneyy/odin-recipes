    <p><h3>Beautifully crispy air fried bone in chicken thighs</h3></p>
    <p>Air frying is a healthier way to crisp up any item you would like.
        the lack of oil is an easy way to maintain healthiness, and deliciousness
        in your foods. This air fryer chicken is reminiscent of a chicken cordon bleu,
        however it is stuffed with turkey, rather than ham.
